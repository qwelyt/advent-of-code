# advent-of-code
Repo to host code used to solve [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) problems


All problems were created by [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/) who is awesome for creating Advent of Code.  
The problem texts are copied into this repo for ease of use and so you can see part 2 without having to log in to AoC and solve the problems.  
You should really give AoC a go. It's a great way to learn new languages!
